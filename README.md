| Jensen  | 3                            | 0.882             | This seems to be a good initial guess for the group's velocity. Due to potential risks, we will decrease this by 0.1 less than the industry standard. We increased our velocity from the last iteration yet were not able to meet our estimated hours for the iteration. |

## Milestone 2 Calculation Summary

- **Total hours estimated:** 29 (15+14)
- **Total hours completed:** 32 (17+15)

## Explanation

For **Milestone 1**, our estimated velocity was .767, with 3 hours of time available per person, planning for approximately 15.34 hours of work each iteration. However, challenges such as bugs and errors in our user stories led to exceeding our initial estimates.

For **Milestone 2**, our estimated velocity improved to .8, with varying hours of availability per person. We planned for around 13.2 hours of work each iteration based on improved velocity estimates. Nonetheless, similar challenges persisted, affecting our ability to meet these adjusted estimates.
